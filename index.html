        <h2>1. Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 304mph</p>
        <p> Price: $3 900 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Quad-turbo 8.0-litre W-16 engine with 1,600 horsepower</p> 
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ is a high performance variant of the Chiron hypercar that set an unofficial production car speed record of 304.77 mph (490.48 km/h). On 2 August 2019 Bugatti presented a limited production high performance variant of the Chiron called the Chiron Super Sport to owners taking part in the company's 110th-anniversary tour in Europe. The variant is limited to 30 examples and closely resembles the prototype performing the top speed record run. Changes from the standard Chiron include a more powerful engine, increased top speed, and a characteristic paint scheme featuring a lacquer-coated carbon fibre body with orange stripes, echoing the aesthetics of the company's previous top speed record-breaking cars, the Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition and the Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse World Record Car. The car is powered by a 1,175 kW (1,580 hp; 1,600 PS) quad-turbocharged W16 engine shared with the Bugatti Centodieci, nicknamed "Thor". This car has a grey Bugatti logo made of black enamel and silver, the exhaust system from the Centodieci, a modified gearbox with longer ratios and front and rear bumpers optimised for aerodynamics at high speed, resulting in the overall length increase of the car by 248.9 mm (9.8 in).
        The Super Sport 300+ will also be equipped with a top speed limiter, akin to the one found in the standard Chiron. Without the limiter, Bugatti claims that the car can attain a maximum speed in excess of 483 km/h (300 mph). Bugatti will also prepare the cars of owners who want to take the car to its full potential at the Ehra-Lessien test track.</p>

        <h2>2. Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 300+mph</p>
        <p>Price: $3 000 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Twin turbocharged V8 engine with 1280 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>Unveiled online alongside the Gemera on 3 March 2020, the Jesko Absolut is a high speed version of the Jesko. The rear wing on the Jesko Attack is replaced by two rear fins which enable a reduction in downforce from 1,400 kg (3,086 lb) to 150 kg (331 lb) and a drag coefficient of Cd=0.278. The front splitter and side winglets are removed and the front louvers are smoother with the rear wheels featuring removable covers for high speed stability. The vehicle is also slightly elongated featuring a rear extension which adds 85 mm (3 in) of additional length. The engine and transmission remain the same as the Jesko Attack. 3,000 hours were spent on the aerodynamic analysis while an additional 5,000 hours were spent design and engineering work of the Absolut. The Absolut will be priced higher than the Jesko due to the development work taken to lower the drag coefficient. The Jesko Absolut is claimed by the manufacturer to have a top speed in excess of 480 km/h (300 mph), with theoretical spеeds as high as 530–560 km/h (330–350 mph) in the right conditions.</p>

        <h2>3. SSC Tuatara</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 295 mph</p>
        <p>Price: $1 600 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: Twin turbo V8 engine with 1,750 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>The SSC Tuatara is the successor to the SSC Ultimate Aero and the result of a design collaboration between Jason Castriota and SSC. SSC has plans to launch the car in 2017. A production version of the SSC Tuatara was shown in August 2018.The SSC Tuatara uses an in-house-developed billet-aluminum 6.9L (6,941 cc) twin-turbocharged V8 engine redlining at 9,200 rpm and delivering a minimum of 1350 hp (1007 kW) and 1042 ft·lb (1413 N·m), both at 6,800 rpm, while the car runs on 91 octane unleaded premium petrol gas. The V8 engine will be capable of higher outputs of up to 1700 hp (1268 kW). The car weighs 2750 lb (1247 kg) thanks to its carbon fiber construction (wheels included) and aluminum crumple zones; all this will allow the Tuatara to manage a power-to-weight ratio of over 1,000 hp per tonne.
        SSC claims that the Tuatara's 0-60 mph sprint will be done in 2.5 seconds, the quarter mile in 9.75 seconds at 144 mph (232 km/h), and the projected speed 276 mph (444 km/h). The Tuatara will record 1.05 g on the skidpad and brake from 60 mph (97 km/h) to a stop in 103 ft (31 m).
        SSC showcased the car's pre-production prototype and components in 2011. Production of the car had been delayed multiple times until 2017, when SSC North America's new headquarters will be at West Richland, Washington. The Tuatara is scheduled to be released in the 2019 model year, with an improvised appearance and produces 1,750 bhp with E85 flex fuel. Its main competitor is the Bugatti Chiron, the Koenigsegg Regera and the Agera RS, and the Hennessey Venom F5.</p>

        <h2>4. Pagani Huayra</h2>
        <p>Top Speed: 238mph</p>
        <p>Price: $20 000 000</p>
        <p>Specifications: AMG derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine with 730 horsepower</p>
        <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
        <p>In March 2021, Pagani introduced the Huayra R, a track-only version of the Huayra and the successor of the Pagani Zonda R. The Huayra R uses the "Pagani V12-R", a 6.0 L naturally aspirated V12 engine built from the ground up with HWA AG to produce 850 PS (625 kW; 838 hp) at 8,250 rpm as well as 750 N⋅m (553 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm to 8300 rpm, and a redline at 9,000 rpm. And it is likely that the new engine was based on the architecture of the M120 engine block by Mercedes-AMG. The Huayra R has a 6-speed sequential transmission newly developed for the car, and various weight saving measures have resulted in a lower dry weight of 1,050 kg (2,315 lb).
        Pagani plans a limited 30-car production run for the Huayra R, similar to the limited 15-car production run of the track-only version of the Pagani Zonda, the Zonda R. It will cost €2.6mln + taxes (around $3.1mln + taxes).</p>

       <h2>5. Rimac Nevera</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 258mph</p>
       <p>Price: $3 000 000</p>
       Specifications: 1,914 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
       <p>The Rimac Nevera is an electric sportscar designed by Croatian manufacturer Rimac Automobili. The original Nevera concept was unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show and named Rimac C_Two, as it was the second car manufactured by the company (after the Rimac Concept One); subsequently, the C_Two was given its current name when it entered production in 2021, with the first production model delivered to 2016 Formula One World Drivers' Champion Nico Rosberg in August 2022. The name "Nevera" comes from the Croatian word for a storm system that is typically accompanied by lightning and mainly occurs in the Adriatic Sea around the coast of Croatia.
       The Nevera's exterior is designed by Croatian-born Austrian Adriano Mudri, taking some cues from the Concept One but incorporating new features, such as butterfly doors and an active spoiler. Each of the Nevera's four wheels are powered by an oil-cooled, single-gear electric motor that give a combined power output of 1914 hp (1427 kW) and 2360 ft·lb (3200 N·m) of torque. The Nevera draws power from a lithium/manganese/nickel battery with a capacity of 120 kWh, giving it an advertised maximum range of 647 km (402 mi) on the NEDC cycle and 490 km (300 mi) on the WLTP cycle. The battery can be charged to 80% capacity within 30 minutes when it is connected to a fast charger. An on-board NVIDIA Drive Pegasus supercomputer, capable of processing 6 TB of data per driving hour, combined with a brake-by-wire system, electric power steering and ultrasonic proximity sensors, gives the Nevera autonomous driving capabilities as well as on-track driving assistance.</p>

       <h2>6. Mclaren Speedtail</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 250mph</p>
       <p>Price: $452,075</p>
       <p>Specifications: 4,0 litre, twin-turbo V8 engine with 1050 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
       <p>The Speedtail is powered by a modified M840T from the 720S and a hybrid powertrain to generate 1,036 hp (773 kW; 1,050 PS). The Speedtail uses a carbon fibre monocoque, with the passenger seats integrated into the chassis, as well as dihedral doors like other McLaren models.
       The company claims that the Speedtail has a top speed of 402.3 km/h (250 mph) and can accelerate from 0–299 km/h (0–186 mph) in 12.8 seconds.Testing was done in Florida at the Kennedy Space Center at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds. The shuttle landing runway was used for the tests. It also tested in tracks in Germany, Spain and Italy.
       In November 2018, McLaren planned to build 106 examples of the Speedtail, all of which have already been sold, at an MSRP of around £2.1 million. Due in part to its use of cameras in lieu of side mirrors and no side-mounted airbags, the Speedtail is not street legal in the United States, even though around 35% of the total cars were bought by American buyers. A spokeswoman for the company stated that the car may be legal, pending approval by NHTSA, to be imported into the U.S. under the “Show or Display” law, which exempts cars that are “historically or technologically significant" from NHTSA safety standards but requires that owners not drive the vehicle more than 2,500 miles in a 12-month period. McLaren has made it clear that they will not offer assistance with importing or registering the Speedtail in the U.S.
       Production of the McLaren Speedtail commenced in the United Kingdom after high-speed testing was completed by December 2019. The prototype XP2 version had "reached its terminal velocity more than 30 times," topping out at 250 mph (403 km/h), and able to go from a standstill to 186 mph (300km/h) in less than 13 seconds. The first deliveries, 106 cars, were slated for February 2020 to Woking, England.</p>

       <h2>7. Koenigsegg Gemera</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 250mph</p>
       <p>Price: $2 500 000</p>
       <p>Specifications: 2.0 litre three-cylinder engine with 600 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
       <p>The Gemera is the first four-seater car built by Koenigsegg and the first to be powered by a compact engine. Power comes from a 2.0 litre Koenigsegg Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG) three-cylinder with 2 turbochargers camless piston engine driving the front wheels, rated at 447 kW (600 hp; 608 PS) and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque, as well as three electric motors (two at the rear and one at the front), with a combined peak output of 1,268 kW (1,700 hp; 1,724 PS) and 3,500 N⋅m (2,581 lb⋅ft) of torque. The given combined peak output is produced when the engine runs on E85 fuel. The engine uses a system of solenoids to activate the intake and exhaust valves instead of conventional camshafts. The engine also features cylinder deactivation with which it is claimed to be 20 percent more fuel efficient than a typical four-cylinder engine of the same displacement. According to Koenigsegg, the combustion engine weighs only 70 kg (150 lb).
       The range on the 54 MJ (15 kWh) battery pack is claimed to be 50 km (31 mi) and while in hybrid mode the range extends to 1,000 km (621 mi). The engine can run on both E85 bio fuel and gasoline and has a titanium exhaust system manufactured by Akrapovič.Being the first all-wheel-drive model, the Gemera has all-wheel steering and torque vectoring. In line with other Koenigsegg models, the chassis has a carbon fibre monocoque with aluminium sub-structures. The car features electronically adjustable ride height.The main design feature of the Gemera is the lack of a B-pillar and two large dihedral doors which open forward to allow easier access to the leather upholstered four-seater cabin. Creature comforts include four heated and four cooled cup-holders, driver assistance systems, four touchscreens (two 13-inch central touchscreens along with two additional screens for the side and rear view cameras), infotainment system for the front and rear passengers, front and rear wireless phone chargers, Apple CarPlay, Wi-Fi connection, a three-zone climate system, electrically adjustable seats and a premium audio system with 11 speakers.</p>

       <h2>8. Aston Martin Valkyrie</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 250mph</p>
       <p>Price: $3 750 000</p>
       <p>Specifications: 6.5-litre hybrid V12 engine with 1,160 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information:</p></b>
       <p>In February 2017, Aston Martin revealed most of the vehicle's specifications. The final specifications were revealed later in the year. Several manufacturers (other than Aston Martin and Red Bull) have taken part in the Valkyrie's construction, those being Cosworth, Ricardo, Rimac Automobili, Multimatic, Alcon, Integral Powertrain Ltd, Bosch, Surface Transforms, Wipac, and Michelin. The car contains a 6.5-litre naturally-aspirated V12 engine tailored by Cosworth, which produces around 1,000 hp (746 kW; 1,014 PS) at 10,500 rpm, with a redline of 11,100 rpm. This will make it the most powerful naturally-aspirated engine ever to be fitted to a production road car, as well as the highest-revving. With a KERS-style boost system akin to those fitted to F1 cars, the Aston Martin Valkyrie’s hybrid system has been developed by two main technical partners; Integral Powertrain Ltd, who supplied the bespoke electric motor, and Rimac for the lightweight hybrid battery system. As a result, the full hybrid system contributes an additional 160 bhp of power and a further 280 N⋅m of available torque with the certified max power output of Aston Martin Valkyrie standing at 1,160 hp (865 kW; 1,176 PS) @ 10,500rpm. Equally, with the full hybrid system, peak torque will stand at 900 N⋅m (664 lbf⋅ft) @ 6,000 rpm. At the same time the power output figures were released, the weight was announced to be 1,030 kg (2,271 lb), surpassing the intended 1:1 power-to-weight ratio with 1,126 hp (840 kW; 1,142 PS) per ton. The car can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) from a standstill in a time of 2.6 seconds. The exhausts exit at the top of the car, near the engine, similar to those of Formula One cars and the Porsche 918 Spyder. Bosch supplies the Valkyrie's ECU unit, traction control system, and ESP. The braking system is provided by Alcon and Surface Transforms. The front and rear lights are manufactured by Wipac. The car has all-carbon fibre bodywork and is installed with a carbon fibre Monocell from manufacturer Multimatic. Michelin supplies the Valkyrie with the company's high-performance Sport Cup 2 tyres, having sizes of 265/35-ZR20 at the front and 325/30-ZR21 at the rear. The wheels are constructed out of lightweight magnesium alloy (20" front, 21" rear) with race-spec centre-lock wheel nuts to reduce mass. In 2020, after Red Bull Racing's Red Bull Racing RB16 had its first shakedown in Silverstone Circuit, drivers Max Verstappen and Alexander Albon drove the car around the track.</p>

       <h2>9. Koenigsegg Agera RS</h2>
       <p>Top Speed: 277mph</p>
       <p>Price: $4 000 000</p>
       <p>Specifications: 5.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine with 1,341 horsepower</p>
       <b><p>Additional Information</p></b>
       <p>The F5 name is a reference to the F5 tornado, the highest rating on the Fujita scale, attaining speeds as high as 261–318 mph (420–512 km/h). Hennessey has contracted with Delta Motorsport of Silverstone, England for the development of the vehicle, which will be the company's first all new proprietary vehicle as an accredited titled manufacturer. Delta Motorsport also produced all of the previous generation Venom GT cars for Hennessey at its facility in England.
       Initial reports had the Venom F5 powered by a completely bespoke and proprietary 7.4 L twin-turbocharged V8 engine; later it was revealed that while being still in development, the engine is to have an even larger capacity of 8.0 liters but the final displacement of the engine was revealed to be 6.6 liters. The engine is confirmed to have a power output of 1,817 hp (1,355 kW; 1,842 PS) and 1,193 lb⋅ft (1,617 N⋅m) of torque. The Venom F5 will have an LS-based iron block engine. The top speed is claimed to be 301 mph (484 km/h) through a V-MAX speed-tracking system. Hennessey predicts the car will accelerate from 0–186 mph (0–300 km/h) in a time of under 10 seconds and from 0–249 mph (0–400 km/h) in a time of about 20 seconds.
       The available transmissions will be a CIMA 7-speed single-clutch automated manual transmission with paddle-shifters, driving the rear wheels, making the car rear-wheel drive along with a 6-speed manual transmission, both transmissions being offered as an option to customers. The chassis and body will be made almost entirely of carbon fiber. Active aerodynamics are now paired with the body, a first for Hennessey. The weight reportedly stands at 2,950 lb (1,338 kg) with fluids, setting the power-to-weight ratio at 1,358 hp per ton. Because of the use of active aerodynamics and a sleek, new design it has an estimated drag coefficient of Cd=0.33. Hennessey has also placed great emphasis on interior space, quality and comfort, and that despite offering extreme performance the vehicle still will offer a spacious and comfortable interior experience that can accommodate tall and large drivers and passengers. It was mentioned that an undisclosed NFL player, who has only been described as being 6'7" tall, has placed an order for one of the first models once full production has commenced. Production will be limited to 24 units, 12 of which were already sold by December 2020. The price of the car in the United States was initially US$1.6 million, but later increased to US$2.1 million for the remaining 12 units. Eight cars are planned to be built and delivered in 2021.</p>
